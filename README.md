# Learning-HTML-and-CSS
This project showcases my progress in learning HTML and CSS fundamentals. It demonstrates semantic HTML structure, responsive web design, Flexbox and Grid layouts, and clean code organization.  I built this project to strengthen my understanding of front-end development principles and best practices while preparing for professional web development.
